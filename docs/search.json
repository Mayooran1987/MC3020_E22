    "text": "Attendance Policy:\nYour attendance to each class (listening) and your genuine effort on the homework assignments and exams (doing) are two of the most important factors affecting your success in this class. This course requires both listening and doing. You will be held accountable for what takes place in class, whether you are present or not. You are responsible for all material covered in classes you miss. Absence from lectures and/or tutorials shall not exceed \\(20\\%\\). Students exceeding the \\(20\\%\\) limit without an accepted medical or emergency excuse are not permitted to take part in the final examination. If your grade falls below \\(80\\%\\) at any point prior to the exam, you must submit a clarification letter through your academic advisor.\nIn course Examinations Make-up Policy\nNo make-up test will be given except emergency with proof and no more than one exception. There are all sorts of reasons that you might have for missing a test. Some reasons may be considered legitimate excuses and some may not. Be careful! What may seem like a legitimate excuse to you may not be considered one by us. What constitutes a legitimate excuse will be at the discretion of the lecturer, but includes such things as illness requiring a visit to the doctor; university-related travel; etc. You must provide proof for all legitimate excuses a note on official letterhead, signed by an appropriate authority: doctor, professor, etc. Even missing a test to attend a family-related event‚Äù must be proved by some form of documentation: a funeral notice, etc. Missing tests because you are late; your bike broke down; you missed the bus, or it ran late; the power went out and your alarm did not wake you (have a battery-powered back-up!); you had to study for another test; you were ill but did not see a doctor; etc., are not considered legitimate excuses. If you know in advance that you are going to miss a test, but you are not sure if the reason will be considered a legitimate excuse, contact the instructor.\nAcademic and Classroom Misconduct\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves appropriately at all times. Academic and classroom misconduct will not be tolerated. Be considerate of your fellow classmates. Turn off/silent mode of your cell phone before entering class unless there are special circumstances requiring your phone to be on. If you must leave class early, sit near the door and leave quietly."
